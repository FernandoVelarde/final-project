To run the program download the files and run the flask application. Bask in the beauty of the art on the first page before inputting the ingredients you have into the search bar and press the search button. Then card should display with different recipes. 
If we did not have the difficulties of a bad API we also wanted to create a third page once you click on one of the cards and more information would display about that specific recipe including the ingredients, steps to make it, and measurements, and you could click on the link to get back to the original site for the recipe.

For future work finding a better API and adjusting the two search functions to that, along with working on adding in the recipe search that Bo created into the flask application.
